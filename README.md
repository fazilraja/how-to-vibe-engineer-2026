# How to Vibe Engineer in 2026

A talk about AI, taste, and not outsourcing the thinking. Presented at **Hacklahoma 2026**.

## What This Is

This repo contains the slides and assets for a talk on the difference between **vibe coding** (blindly accepting AI output) and **vibe engineering** (steering AI with understanding and intent).

Topics covered:

- How AI tools are reshaping software engineering for new grads and experienced devs
- Why "easy" and "simple" aren't the same thing
- The three archetypes: Beta Dev, Gambler, and Engineer
- Context engineering: Research → Spec → Implementation
- How tools like Claude Code actually work under the hood
- Why the hard part was never typing — it's knowing *what* to type
